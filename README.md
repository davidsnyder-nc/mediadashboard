* **Security:** Since API keys and tokens are stored in your browser's `localStorage`, be mindful of who has access to your computer and browser, especially if using a shared machine.
* **Local Network:** This dashboard is primarily designed for accessing services running on your local network. If your services are exposed externally, ensure they are secured appropriately.
* **API Limits:** There are no explicit rate limit handling mechanisms built into this dashboard. For typical home use, this should not be an issue.
